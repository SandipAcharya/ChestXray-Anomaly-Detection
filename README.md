# X-ray Anomaly Detection using Computer Vision

This is our Minor Project based on **Computer Vision**, focused on detecting **13 different anomalies** in chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Automatically detect and classify anomalies in chest X-rays.
- **Dataset**: Combined datasets from NIH ChestXray14 and others.
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved around **65%–70%** accuracy.
- **Techniques Used**: 
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Data Augmentation
  - YOLOv7 for object detection
  - Transfer Learning
  - Albumentations for preprocessing
